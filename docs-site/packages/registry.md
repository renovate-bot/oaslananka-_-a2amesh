# @a2amesh/registry

`@a2amesh/registry` implements the control plane for agent registration, capability discovery, health checks, and signature verification of agent cards.

## Purpose

- **Agent Discovery**: Query registered agents by capabilities, tenant IDs, and namespaces.
- **Trust & Health**: Tracks active agent statuses, performs periodic health polling, and verifies cryptographic signatures on cards.
- **Unified Registry API**: Serves JSON-RPC endpoints for registration and matching.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @a2amesh/registry
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { RegistryServer } from '@a2amesh/registry';

const registry = new RegistryServer({
  port: 4000,
  storage: 'memory',
});

await registry.start();
```

## API Reference

See the [OpenAPI specification](/openapi/registry.openapi.json) for the complete registry API reference.

## Release State

- **Channel**: Public Alpha
- **Initial Version**: `0.1.0-alpha.0`

## Production Redis and Distributed Polling

Production registry deployments should use Redis-backed storage when more than one registry instance is active.

Redis storage provides:

- set-based indexes for status, tenant, skill, tag, name, transport, MCP compatibility, and public discovery queries;
- batched mutations with Redis transactions when the client exposes `multi()`;
- fallback JSON-array indexes for simple Redis-like clients used in tests and local prototypes;
- polling lease records under the registry prefix for distributed health and task polling coordination.

### Distributed polling leases

Set `distributedPollingLeases: true` when multiple registry processes share the same Redis storage. The polling controller then attempts a Redis-backed lease before scheduled health checks or task snapshot polling.

Recommended options:

```typescript
new RegistryServer({
  storage: redisStorage,
  distributedPollingLeases: true,
  pollingLeaseOwnerId: process.env.HOSTNAME,
  pollingLeaseTtlMs: 60_000,
});
```

Lease behavior:

- only the instance that acquires the lease runs the scheduled polling tick;
- other instances skip that tick and try again on the next interval;
- stale lease records are overwritten when their `expiresAt` value is in the past;
- the owner releases the lease after the polling operation completes;
- TTL should be at least twice the polling interval for normal deployments.

### Failure handling assumptions

- Health check failures increment `consecutiveFailures` and mark the agent unhealthy.
- Successful checks reset `consecutiveFailures` and update `lastSuccessAt`.
- Task polling skips malformed payloads and non-array responses rather than poisoning the registry projection.
- Redis clients used in production should support `SET ... NX PX`, set commands, and transactions. Without those capabilities, deployments should run a single registry poller or keep `distributedPollingLeases` disabled.

## Tenant Trust and Signed Agent Cards

Registry deployments can require signed Agent Cards globally or per tenant.

Recommended production options:

```typescript
new RegistryServer({
  registrationToken: process.env.A2AMESH_REGISTRY_TOKEN,
  requireSignedAgentCards: true,
  trustedAgentCardKeys: [globalVerificationKey],
  tenantTrustPolicies: {
    'tenant-a': {
      requireSignedAgentCards: true,
      trustedAgentCardKeys: [tenantAVerificationKey],
      allowPublicAgents: false,
    },
  },
});
```

Trust behavior:

- unsigned Agent Cards are stored as `unverified` unless the global or tenant policy requires signatures;
- required unsigned or invalid signed cards are rejected during registration;
- tenant-specific verification keys are combined with global keys and deduplicated by `keyId`;
- public registration can be disabled per tenant with `allowPublicAgents: false`;
- import skips agents that fail the active tenant trust policy rather than poisoning the registry.

Stored `verification` metadata includes:

- whether a signature was required;
- whether verification succeeded;
- trust state: `trusted`, `unverified`, or `rejected`;
- verified key ID when available;
- tenant ID when scoped;
- verification timestamp;
- failure reason for unverified or rejected cards.

This metadata is included in registry exports so downstream control planes can preserve trust evidence.

## Trust Log

Every registry maintains an in-memory, append-only trust log (`ITrustLogStorage`). Whenever an Agent Card registration is verified as `trusted`, the registry appends an entry recording the card's SHA-256 hash (`hashAgentCard` from `@a2amesh/runtime`), the verifying key id and algorithm, the agent URL, the tenant id when scoped, and a timestamp. Each entry also carries an `entryHash` chained from the previous entry's hash, so altering any earlier entry changes every hash after it — the same tamper-evidence pattern used by [cassette record/replay](https://github.com/oaslananka/a2amesh/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr/0011-cassette-record-replay.md).

The log is exposed read-only, without authentication, at:

- `GET /trust-log` — all entries in append order (`?limit=` returns only the most recent N).
- `GET /trust-log/:cardHash` — entries for one specific Agent Card hash.

Unsigned or untrusted registrations never append an entry. The `a2amesh trust` CLI command signs and verifies Agent Cards and inspects a running registry's trust log — see [`a2amesh trust`](../cli/trust.md).

See [ADR-0013: Agent Card Trust Log](https://github.com/oaslananka/a2amesh/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr/0013-agent-card-trust-log.md) for the design rationale.

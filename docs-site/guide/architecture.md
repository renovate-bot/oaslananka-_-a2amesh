# Architecture

The canonical architecture document lives in
[docs/development/architecture.md](https://github.com/oaslananka/a2amesh/blob/main/docs/development/architecture.md).

It covers package dependency direction, runtime request flow, JSON-RPC dispatch, task
lifecycle, storage, registry polling, outbound URL policy, auth, telemetry, release flow,
and the tests and ADRs that protect those decisions.

## Package Direction

```text
types/schemas -> core runtime -> transports -> client/registry -> adapters/bridges -> CLI/apps
```

`packages/runtime` owns protocol types, schemas, runtime, client primitives, storage,
and outbound network policy. Auth and telemetry live in separate packages
(`packages/auth`, `packages/telemetry`) and are re-exported through `packages/runtime`.
Transports, registry, adapters, bridges, CLI, apps,
docs-site, and examples consume public package APIs above that layer.

## Workspace graph

Run the graph check when package boundaries change:

```bash
node scripts/check-workspace-graph.mjs --summary
```

Expected summary:

```text
Workspace graph validation passed.
Checked 8 public package import aliases across 36 forbidden dependency edges.
Dependency direction: types/schemas -> core runtime -> transports -> registry -> adapters/bridges -> CLI/apps.
```

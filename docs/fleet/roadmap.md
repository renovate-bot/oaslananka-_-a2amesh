# Fleet Roadmap

The Fleet roadmap outlines the trajectory for integrating fleet capabilities into A2A Mesh across milestones M0 to M5. This document focuses on the fleet-specific additions. For general protocol and ecosystem standards, refer to our existing cross-cutting epics.

## Existing Standards (Cross-References)

We adhere strictly to established A2A Mesh standards for these capabilities:

- **Architecture**: See [ADR-0009: Fleet Architecture](../architecture/adr/0009-fleet-architecture.md) and [Fleet Control Plane Architecture](control-plane.md).
- **Conformance**: See [Protocol Compatibility](../protocol/compatibility.md) for A2A conformance fixture versioning.
- **Security**: See the [Threat Model](../security/threat-model.md) for trust boundaries and authentication policies.
- **Release**: See the [Release Process](../release/process.md) for publishing mechanics and artifact expectations.

## Milestones

### Fleet M0 — Scope, Architecture, and Governance

- Establish foundational architecture and agent metadata.
- Initial definitions of Fleet agent capabilities.
- Define Fleet package boundaries.

### Fleet M1 — Domain Model, Worker Runtime, and Registry

- Implement basic Fleet message structures and schemas.
- Introduce inter-agent communication data models.
- Support basic routing metadata.

### Fleet M2 — Policy, Artifacts, and Sandboxed Execution

- Build local execution environments for Fleet workers.
- Add generic provider adapters tailored for Fleet interactions.
- Enable single-node multi-agent testing.

### Fleet M3 — OpenCode, OpenRouter, and Local Issue Workflows

- Develop distributed task dispatch mechanisms.
- Extend the registry for dynamic Fleet discovery.
- Enhance matching strategies for specialized Fleet roles.

### Fleet M4 — Multi-Agent Review Chains and Mission Control

- Audit inter-agent communication channels.
- Expand conformance fixtures with Fleet-specific multi-agent scenarios.
- Fortify boundaries as outlined in the Threat Model.

### Fleet M5 — Claude, Codex, Gemini, and IDE Worker Integrations

- Stabilize API surfaces across all Fleet packages.
- Finalize documentation and end-to-end examples.
- Official release aligned with standard release processes.

## Architecture and Non-goals

See [ADR-0009: Fleet Architecture](../architecture/adr/0009-fleet-architecture.md) and [Fleet Control Plane Architecture](control-plane.md) for the integration boundaries, provider-neutral core, and human approval for external side effects.
